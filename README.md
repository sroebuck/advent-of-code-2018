# Some of advent-of-code-2018 in Rust

I'm using Rust 2018 (because it came yesterday!)

At the moment my tools of choice are:

* VSCode
    * with the Rust (rls) extension
    * `editor.fontLigatures` set `true` (for Fira Code)
    * The `editor.formatOnSave` setting set to `true`.
    * The `rust.clippy_preference' set to `on`.
* Fira Code font
* [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) installed with `rustup component add clippy`.
